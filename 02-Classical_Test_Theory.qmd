# Classical Test Theory {#sec-ctt}

In Psychology, questionnaires or scales are a crucial part of the
assessment. These scales provide importante information about a person.
For instance, when doing an educational assessment, a test score on the
exam can be a key indicator of the extent to which the person has
mastered the knowledge of that domain.

In psychometric latent variable modeling, measurement occurs when a test
score reflects a persons' ability in a specific area. However, this
score is far from reflecting this ability in a perfect manner. It's easy
to see that a person can vary its performance in an educational test if
they answer in different times, Thus, the examination is not perfect,
and has what we call **measurement error**. In addition, the ability is
an unobserved variable (i.e., not observed directly, but inferred by a
persons' score). To take all of this into account, a classical test
theory (CTT) have been proposed to evaluate scale scores.

## Overview of Classical Test Theory

In CTT, the main idea is that the score of a participant in a given
assessment (denoted as $X$) can be decomposed into their true score
($T$) and a random error component ($E$): $$
X = T + E
$$ $T$ can be defined as the expected value of the observed score over
an infinite number of repeat administrations in the same examination.
Or, $T$ can be thought as the score if the scale was perfectly measuring
the ability of a given person (i.e., without the measurement error). $X$
is the raw score of the participant, and $E$ is the measurement error.
@fig-testtheory shows the relationship between these elements.

The main task for CTT is to elaborate strategies to control or evaluate the magnitude of $E$. While $E$ can be caused by a number of factors, such as problems with the test, bias from the participants, historical or environmental factors,
etc. (Pasquali, 2017). However, there's no way to know the true score
($T$) of a participant if there were no measurement error ($E$). In
fact, both $T$ and $E$ are unobserved variables. Thus, to use this
model, we have to make our first assumption: one can define $T$ as the
expected value of the observed scores X (i.e., $E(X)=T$), which leads to
the expected value of E being zero ($E(E)=0$); or one can define the
expected value of $E$ as zero, which leads to $T$ being the expected value
of $X$. Both ways of proceeding with the assumption lead to the same
result, but they differ with respect to what is assumed, and what is a
consequence of the assumptions (Brennan, 2011).

The structure of the CTT model equation ($X=T+E$) bears a striking
resemblance to a straightforward linear regression equation, leading one
to interpret $E$ merely as model fitting error in the conventional
statistical sense. However, such an interpretation is, at best,
misleading. The CTT model operates as a tautology, wherein all variables
on the right-hand side remain unobservable, and these unobservable
variables lack inherent meaning beyond the assumptions we impose on
them. Notably, $T$ does not possess an independent status from the other
variables in the model, rendering it inappropriate to characterize $E$
as a residual or model fitting error (Brennan, 2011).

## Reliability in CTT

The standard definition of reliability typically refers to the squared
correlation between observed and true scores, denoted as $\rho^2(X,T)$.
Additional expressions for reliability are provided below (Brennan,
2011): 

$$
\rho^2(X,T)=\rho(X,X')=\frac{\sigma^2(T)}{\sigma^2(X)}=\frac{\sigma^2(T)}{\sigma^2(T)+\sigma^2(E)}
$$


The last three formulations are typically obtained by assuming that, for
an indefinitely large population of participants: (1) test forms
(denoted as $X$ and $X'$) are parallel, meaning they share identical
observed score means, variances, and covariances, and they exhibit equal
covariance with any other measure; (2) the covariance between errors for
parallel forms is zero; and (3) the covariance between true and error
scores is zero (Brennan, 2011). The reliability estimates tend to align
more with the last two expressions in the equation provided earlier,
both explicitly addressing true score variance, a value that remains
elusive. Typically, these estimates leverage the understanding that the
covariance between scores for classically parallel forms equals the true
score variance, denoted as $\sigma(X, X') = \sigma^2(T)$. Coefficient
$\alpha$ stands out as the most used among these coefficients.
